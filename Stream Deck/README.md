# Use an Elgato StreamDeck to control Blackmagic ATEM switcher
[<img src="ttps://ianmorrish.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/streamdeckblog.jpg">]
Requires the StreamDeckSharp.dll DLL from <https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApGpqMMpRLhikIdCTPjBasmUmcKOtw>
And switcherlib.dll from <https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApGpqMMpRLhikIk639GzTxdvgeAncg>

The updating of active program/preview is not optimized and sometimes lags.
